            <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></a>
            <p>A club created by Lone Star College students, Sam, Michael, Dale, and Heather, to honor fellow Veterans who attend Lone Star. We want our veterans to be welcomed home, and be integrated back into society without being viewed as outcasts. This club will help Veterans return to their civilian lives, as well as be able to share stories and information with others who are interested in what they do.</p>
            <H3>Goal</H3>
            <p>Our goal is to integrate students who are veterans and who are not. We want to eliminate the stigma associated with PTSD. View our <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7j9dfuywmv1TzJoSHB6bHNCWkU">powerpoint</a> for more information and meeting times and places.</p>
